## Credits: 

This application was created by Annie George, Josh Williams and Mariana Pritchard as part of a project for Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. It uses open source software (p5.js, React, Bootstrap, APIs, etc ). Thank you to all the contributors who have made these tools and technologies available to use. 

A special thanks to Daniel Shiffman for his boundless energy and commitment to the p5js community. Also, Rune Madse's "programming design Systems" will be a reference for many projects to come.
